### Description 
I have created a chat app using ReactJS, Node.js, Socket.io, and GitHub Codespaces. The app allows users to engage in real-time chat conversations. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages, as well as displaying the chat history. The app is  simple and easy to deploy.

## Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?) 

I decided to build this chat app for the GitHub x Dev Hackathon because I wanted to create a real-time communication tool that could be used for various purposes, such as friendly collaboration, or community engagement. I was inspired by the increasing demand for remote communication tools such as whatsapp,slack and wanted to contribute to the development of such applications.

### How I built it (How did you utilize GitHub Actions or GitHub Codespaces? Did you learn something new along the way? Pick up a new skill?) 

Github Codespace used really good for less storage capacity in device  so I utilized GitHub Codespaces, which is an online development environment provided by GitHub. It allowed me to have a consistent development environment across different machines and made it easy to collaborate with others. I used ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and clients.

Throughout the development process, I learned more about setting up a real-time communication system using Socket.io and how to handle concurrent connections. I also gained experience in deploying applications using GitHub Codespaces and leveraging GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
Building chat application throughout the hackathon provided me a great learning experience and allowed me to create a functional and scalable application for real-time communication.
